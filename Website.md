# Create a web interface to display some videos

The objective of our project is to create a High Available (HA) cluster on some Raspberry Pi using k3s and the aim of this cluster to 
deploy a video streaming platform.

This tutorial is made for all people who want to set up a platform displaying videos. It is really basic and the aim is to have something working properly before implementing other functionalities.
